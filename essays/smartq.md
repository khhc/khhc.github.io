The ability to achieve a self-directed form of learning is of utmost important at this time. With public spaces such as educational facilities being off-limits for the safety of everyone, scholars are restricted to their own resources. Unfortunately, many scholars are having difficulties adapting and adjusting to the online learning environment. Because of this, most scholars often turn to the internet to search for techniques that can aid us in our education, from videos to straight-up answers. However, how one searches plays a major role in how much one learns. Therefore, it is essential that we learn the online etiquettes and respect the expectations that certain online environments may have for us.

While we have moved online, the transition has not been easy for the majority of us. We may feel like the workload has increased significantly just from working at home, a space we may associate relaxation and leisure with. Because of this, our laziness may make us feel inclined to just get our school load over with. As a result, you may find scholars on help sites for their specific fields looking for answers without any motivation to learn. [This link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19492093/deleting-first-node-of-linked-list) has a short and concise description, followed by a decently lengthy amount of code. The user gives a brief description of the task at hand, followed by asking the community for answers. This approach shows that the user has put little to no thought into the problem at hand, nor a desire to find out why the aforementioned code is nonfunctional. Instead, the user displays a "take it from here" kind of attitude, implying that they essentially gave up on making further progress without any aid.

Alternatively, [this link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23279119/creating-and-understanding-linked-lists-of-structs-in-c/23280743#23280743) starts off with a rather broad title, but goes in-depth into what the user understands about the topic. The user presents the concepts which confuse them, along with some questions related to the concepts as a good foundatioal ground towards understanding. The user explicitly asks any responders to avoid sending code at all costs, as the user wants to learn from a conceptual standpoint, rather than a copy-and-paste perspective. I noticed that the latter link had better and more thought-out responses. It shows that the more interest and foundation you have on the subject, the more thorough other users will be in their responses.
