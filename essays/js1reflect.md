The last time I coded in Javascript was my junior year of high school, when we were learning about website development. During that time, we learned simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. But, as with any other skills we learn in life, our knowledge deteriorates if left unused for extended periods of time. Luckily for me, I continued to explore other coding languages throughout my computer science degree. When it came time to revisit JavaScript for my ICS 314 course, I found myself in a rather familiar environment. Coming fresh off of a course in the C programming language, the transition so far has been rather easy on me.

Like most coding languages, JavaScript has the ability to make variables and functions. Even more conveniently, the type of variable is not important in the declaration, only its permissions. This meant that I could write a string variable or a float variable under the same keyword. Because of this, function parameters did not need a type specification, unlike Java or C. However, I was still able to learn quite a bit over the first week, the most valuable of which included objects and
```
let num = parseInt(char);
```
which allows me to turn a number character into a number value.

The online environment is definitely different from an in-person environment, but I ironically believe that this gives me an opportunity to learn code for myself. Coding is one of those skills that take experience rather than exposure in order to be best perceived. It is difficult to learn how to code by watching someone else code; rather, getting that hands-on experience gives you a "muscle memory" type of understanding, as well as the satisfaction that your thousand-plus line program works. So far, I have found myself learning code better outside of a classroom environment and on my own pace than in a classroom environment. I think that using class time to test one's knowledge, not necessarily in the form of an exam, is the most optimal way for a coding class to use their time. My favorite outcome of answering a common prompt individually is seeing the different ways other people may approach the solution. It shows how fluid coding can be, despite how black and white the subject may seem.
