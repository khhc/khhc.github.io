I last met HTML and CSS over five years ago, when they were just simple lines of code. Back then, I mainly got to spend my time with HTML, and I barely got to know CSS. Unfortunately, the longer I went without seeing them, the less I remembered about them. Not soon enough, our paths crossed once again, and they have definitely matured in our time apart. HTML easily exceeded 50 lines of code, and CSS now had its own file now, rather than holding in-line hands with HTML. I knew we had a lot of catching up to do, but because I spent my most recent time with languages like Java and Javascript, I did not really speak the lingo that I spoke with HTML and CSS back then. However, this was an uphill journey that I was excited to partake in.

Of course, like all things we revisit in life, it did not take long before I started getting familiar again with HTML and CSS on a beginner's scale. Relearning via FreeCodeCamp was extremely helpful. Soon enough, I moved to more complicated websites and as a result, had to work with tougher formats and such. Semantic UI was the bridge I used to get from my novice experience to this newfound complexity. At first, Semantic UI was a very simple-to-follow procedure; it came with classes that were named accordingly to what the class does. Later down the line, as the class types became more complex, it started clashing with my understanding of HTML and CSS. My approach to these coding languages were always bottom-up; in my first experiences, I started from scratch to build a website. With Semantic UI, the CSS is essentially done for you, which is definitely helpful in some cases, but not in the event that something goes awry. Tracing which keyword is responsible for the inconvenience can be a major hassle, especially in my case, where I had less than a week's experience with Semantic UI.

Taken as a whole, the experience I got with Semantic UI had its pros and cons. The class names were extremely helpful in seeing helping me see what was being affected. I especially like the "right" property that was really useful in seeing which objects get gravitated to the right. On the other hand, combining keywords into this monstrosity of a class name was useful only if nothing went wrong. Otherwise, it was a tracing nightmare. Nonetheless, I got to catch up a little bit with HTML and CSS. Moving forward, now having obtained more familiarity with both of them, I am certain that I will be able to create more intricate websites, regardless of whether I will have to use Semantic UI or not.
